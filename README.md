# Aranki Deck 

## Intro

Aranki deck contains grammar concepts that are part of Madina Arabic Book series and vocabulary from [arabic.desert-sky.net](https://arabic.desert-sky.net/) website. For grammar concepts cloze deletions were used as their ability to greatly help in memorization.

## Resources

### Grammar

The Book that I've used to create this deck is **Arabic Language For Non-Native Speakers English Key** which is used in University of Madina. And complementary material was **ARIC - Arabic Class Notes** by Dr. AbdurRahman (thanks to him for reserving no copyrights for this material).

Links are available in the Download section below.

## Deck's Structure

**Regarding deck's structure**. I decided to divide this book into **two distinct parts**. One part will be dealing with **grammar**, while another is with **vocabulary**.

## Tags of the Deck

**Regarding Grammar and Vocabulary Tags**. There are only two subdecks in the Deck, and I've decided to not add any further subdecks. Instead, it is further divided into **tags** using [Hierarchical Tags 2 add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/594329229) which is essential to download in order to be able to use these tags.

The main tag which includes all of the Deck content is "@aranki". Under this tag you can find pretty intuitively structured content.

As of (v4), ANKI Madina Arabic Deck consists of 5600+ notes (approx. 12000 cards). 

## Fields of Grammar Deck

**Regarding fields**. There are seven fields in Arabic Grammar Note Type:

* cloze:Text
* Back Extra
* hint:Book Extra Notes
* hint:ARIC - Arabic Class Notes
* hint:ARIC - Tables
* hint:Personal Notes
* hint:Tags

**Cloze** and **Back Extra** will show up as you answer the card. 

Those, which are tagged "**hint**", will show themselves up if they have got some content in it and will require you to tap on them to show this content.

## Notes styling

While I was learning grammar, I noticed that some notes needed special styling rules that's why I decided to add some rules on how the cards are stylized.

I also encourage you to use the styling described below when posting something on this community.

### Conjugation of words

All words conjugations will be written inside [...] in short forms. The short forms are: 

* Grammatical Person
	* [fp] is for first person
	* [sp] is for second person
	* [tp] is for third person
* Grammatical Gender
	* [m] is for masculine
	* [f] is for feminine
* Grammatical Number
	* [s] is for singular
	* [p] is for plural

For clarity, all of the above abbreviations are arranged in the following order:

[{*person*}.{*gender*}.{*number*}]

, where every single components of the construction is subdivided by (.), so **second person masculine plural**, according to this concept, is going to be [sp.m.p]. It just takes less space and looks fine. 

The **boldness** of font doesn't matter because I make English text **bold** when it is part of Cloze Deletion. 

### Translation of words/sentences

All English translations of words or sentences will be specified inside (...) WITHOUT *italic* font-style.

### Transliteration of words/sentences

All English transliterations of words or sentences will be specified inside (...) WITH *italic* font-style.

### References to Books

In some notes you'll wind something like this:

B2L24 or B1E1

The meaning of each letter is the following:

* B is for Book
* E is for Exercise
* L is for Lesson

## Vocabulary

### Resources

**Regarding resources for Vocabulary cards**. Two sources were used to create vocabulary for the deck. The first one is list of new words that comes at the end of each lesson (approx. 450 words). The second is vocabulary from [arabic.desert-sky.net](https://arabic.desert-sky.net/) website (approx. 4000 words). This resource includes 24 different word lists that you can memorize. (No need to memorize them all at once, only as needed)

### Forms of cards

**Regarding Vocabulary cards forms**. All cards in vocabulary come in two forms. The first one is (EN)>(AR) (from English to Arabic), the second one is (AR)>(EN) (from Arabic to English). 

### Structure of Arabic Section

**Regarding structure of Arabic Section**. I tried to find plural forms approximately for all of the words which are in the Deck and put them inside braces after singular form of the given word. See screenshot below.

## Fonts

**Regarding fonts**. Two main fonts are used in this deck. They are [**Noto Serif**](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif) and [**Noto Naskh Arabic**](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Naskh+Arabic?query=Mirko+Velimirovic%2F).

Starting from (v2), [**Noto Serif**](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif) and [**Noto Naskh Arabic**](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Naskh+Arabic?query=Mirko+Velimirovic%2F) are official fonts of AKNI Madina Arabic deck. They are looking good.

Furthermore, both of these fonts are installed inside ANKI Madina Arabic Deck. So, there's no need to download each font separately to make it work within your device. Whether its your mobile or school computer, the Deck will look the same across all platforms. 

## Night Mode

Night mode is fully compatible with the Deck.

## Futher Updates

**Regarding further updates**. I've decided to improve my arabic reading and I think that FSI - Modern Written Arabic 2 is really a good book. It has text articles and along with them list of grammar concepts that were included in each article. And as a grammar reference I will use A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic by Karin C. Ryding for it itself is a great book for MSA and for it has plenty of other references inside each unit. Thus, I've decided to go my own way in learning arabic grammar. Still the deck will get updates.

Updates will be available in [r/aranki](https://www.reddit.com/r/aranki/) community and in GitHub repository [roesmaien / aranki](https://github.com/roesmaien/aranki).

Keep yourself up to date.
