## **preV5** notes

* *madina* course is deprecated and won't be updated any longer

  * still available under `madina` tag

  i've been learning this language for 2 years, and have noticed that madina
  arabic/islamic language course was originally written in arabic. translating it into
  english, in my opinion, was bad, for there is difference between modern
  western and *islamic* methodology of education.

  one of means of *islamic* methodology of education implies that you need a
  teacher who sits before you and corrects you as soon as you make mistake.

  the thing with madina arabic course, is that there're so many excerpts from
  the 8ur2an, so in my opinion, this one fact already makes it islamic. so
  should be taught by means of islamic methodology. i bear in mind certain
  percent of those who use this deck are self-learners. and i really don't want
  these autodidacts of arabic to spell these excerpts incorrectly,
  that's why the decision was made.

* `fsi_saudi` tag added
* vocabulary
  * ability to add notes to every single entry
  (basically semantics and context)
