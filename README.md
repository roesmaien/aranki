# ANKI Madina Arabic Deck (v2).

## Intro

This is ANKI version of Madina Arabic Book series. There 3 books in this series which are availbale in English language. As of (v2) I've finished only two of these books, so check for future updates. **ANKI Madina Arabic Deck** (further **the Deck**) is recommended as additional resources to help you better remember grammatical concepts and new words that you will encounter during your language learning.

## Resources

**Regarding resources**. The Book that I've used to create this deck is **Arabic Language For Non-Native Speakers English Key** which is used in University of Madina. And complementary material was **ARIC - Arabic Class Notes** by Dr. AbdurRahman (thanks to him for reserving no copyrights for this material).

Links are available in the Download section below.

## Deck's Structure

**Regarding deck's structure**. I decided to divide this book into **two distinct parts**. One part will be dealing with **grammar**, while another is with **vocabulary**.

## Tags of the Deck

**Regarding Grammar and Vocabulary Tags**. As there are only two subdecks in the Deck, it is further divided into **tags** using [Hierarchical Tags 2 add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/594329229) which is essential to download in order to be able to use these tags. These tags are:

* **Book 1 Grammar** under the tag @madinah::book1::grammar
* **Book 2 Grammar** under the tag @madinah::book2::grammar
* **Vocabulary of Book 1** under the tag @madinah::book1::vocabulary
* **Vocabulary of Book 2** under the tag @madinah::book2::vocabulary

As of (v2), ANKI Madina Arabic Deck consists of 2300+ cards. 

## Fields of Grammar Deck

**Regarding fields**. There are six fields in Arabic Grammar Note Type:

* cloze:Text
* Back Extra
* hint:Book Extra Notes
* hint:ARIC - Arabic Class Notes
* hint:ARIC - Tables
* hint:Personal Notes

**Cloze** and **Back Extra** will show up as you answer the card. Those, which are tagged "**hint**", require you to tap on them to show the content.

## Vocabulary

### Resources

**Regarding resources for Vocabulary cards**. Vocabulary for Book 1 and Book 2 has been added using [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) and [The Hans Wehr Dictionary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SqKKRS_Qwuy0N6q3HwCusK7hrpEioBa0/view?usp=sharing).

### Forms of cards

**Regarding Vocabulary cards forms**. All cards in vocabulary come in two forms. The first one is (EN)>(AR) (from English to Arabic), the second one is (AR)>(EN) (from Arabic to English). 

### Structure of Arabic Section

**Regarding structure of Arabic Section**. I tried to find plural forms approximately for all of the words which are in the Deck and put them inside braces after singular form of the given word. See screenshot below.

## Fonts

**Regarding fonts**. Two main fonts are used in this deck. They are [**Noto Serif**](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif) and [**Noto Naskh Arabic**](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Naskh+Arabic?query=Mirko+Velimirovic%2F).

Starting from (v2), [**Noto Serif**](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif) and [**Noto Naskh Arabic**](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Naskh+Arabic?query=Mirko+Velimirovic%2F) are official fonts of AKNI Madina Arabic deck. They are looking good.

Furthermore, both of these fonts are installed inside ANKI Madina Arabic Deck. So, there's no need to download each font separately to make it work within your device. Whether its your mobile or school computer, the Deck will look the same across all platforms.

## Night Mode

Night mode is fully compatible with the Deck.

## Futher Updates

**Regarding further updates**. I think to add some symbolic representation to distinguish between English translation, transliteration and conjugation of words, so the structure of cards is the same across the Deck. Some work on vocabulary cards will be done. Also I am working on tables for Grammar of Book 1 & Book 2 using **ARIC - Arabic Class Notes** (Link is provided below).

Updated deck will be available in [r/aranki](https://www.reddit.com/r/aranki/) community and in GitHub repository [roesmaien / aranki](https://github.com/roesmaien/aranki)

Keep yourself up to date.
