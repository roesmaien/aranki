## Introducing v3 of ANKI Madina Arabic Deck

The notes became better.

## Styling

While I was learning cards on Grammar, I noticed that they don't have the structure that emphasizes distinct parts of the cards you have to remember. That's why I decided to add some rules on have the cards are stylized.

I also encourage you to use the styling described below when posting something in this community.

### Conjugation of words

All words conjugations will be written inside [...] in short forms. The short forms are: 

* Grammatical Person
	* [fp] is for first person
	* [sp] is for second person
	* [tp] is for third person
* Grammatical Gender
	* [m] is for masculine
	* [f] is for feminine
* Grammatical Number
	* [s] is for singular
	* [p] is for plural

For clarity, all of the above abbreviations are arranged in the following order:

[{*person*}.{*gender*}.{*number*}]

, where every single component of the construction is subdivided by (.), so **second person masculine plural**, according to this concept, is going to be [sp.m.p]. It just takes less space and looks fine. 

The **boldness** of font doesn't matter because I make English text **bold** when it is part of Cloze Deletion. 

### Translation of words/sentences

All English translations of words or sentences will be specified inside (...) WITHOUT *italic* font-style.
