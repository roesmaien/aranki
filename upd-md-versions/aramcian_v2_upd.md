## Intro

This is version 2 of ANKI Madina Arabic Deck (further **the Deck**). In this update I've added 3 tags which corresponds to:
 
* Grammar of Book 1
* Vocabulary of Book 1 and Book 2
* Added new font for English
* Fixed some Night Mode Bugs

## Decks

Regarding decks. As the Deck heavily relies on Hierarchical Tags 2 Add-on I've added 3 main tags:

* **Book 1 Grammar** under the tag @madinah::book1::grammar
* **Vocabulary of Book 1** under the tag @madinah::book1::vocabulary
* **Vocabulary of Book 2** under the tag @madinah::book2::vocabulary

As of (v2), ANKI Madina Arabic Deck consists of 2300+ cards. 

Still, it's required to install [**Hierarchical Tags 2 Add-on**](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/594329229) to manage these tags. 

## Vocabulary

### Resources

Regarding resources for Vocabulary cards. Vocabulary for Book 1 and Book 2 has been added using [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) and [The Hans Wehr Dictionary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SqKKRS_Qwuy0N6q3HwCusK7hrpEioBa0/view?usp=sharing).

### Forms of cards

Regarding Vocabulary cards forms. All cards in vocabulary come in two forms. The first one is (EN)>(AR) (from English to Arabic), the second one is (AR)>(EN) (from Arabic to English). 

### Structure of Arabic Section

Regarding structure of Arabic Section. I tried to find plural forms approximately for all of the words which are in the Deck and put them inside braces after singular form of the given word. See screenshot below.

## Fonts

Regarding English font. I decided to use [**Noto Serif**](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif) font by Google instead of **Charter**.

Starting from now, [**Noto Serif**](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif) and [**Noto Naskh Arabic**](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Naskh+Arabic?query=Mirko+Velimirovic%2F) are official fonts of AKNI Madina Arabic deck. They are looking good.

Furthermore, both of these fonts are installed inside ANKI Madina Arabic Deck. So, there's no need to download each font separately to make it work within your device. Whether its your mobile or school computer, the Deck will look the same across all platforms.

## Night Mode Styles

Some bugs that occured in the Night Mode were also fixed. So the Deck's colors are working more stable in Night Mode, creating nice contrast between the content and the background. 

## Futher Updates

Regarding further updates. I think to add some symbolic representation to distinguish between English translation, transliteration and conjugation of words, so the structure of cards is the same across the Deck. Some work on vocabulary cards will be done. Also I am working on tables for Grammar of Book 1 & Book 2 using **ARIC - Arabic Class Notes** (Link is provided below).

Updated deck will be available in [r/aranki](https://www.reddit.com/r/aranki/) community and in GitHub repository [roesmaien / aranki](https://github.com/roesmaien/aranki)

Keep yourself up to date.
