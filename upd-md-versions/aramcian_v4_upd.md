## Introducing Aranki Deck

Going Beyond.

## The Deck Title Changed

Old title of the deck (ANKI Madina Arabic Deck) represented the main source which had been utilized to create it. But as the new vocabulary was added from outside this book series I thought that it is going to be appropriate to change the title. Therefore, the new title has been created.

Changing the title also required to change the main tag of the deck. Therefore, you'll find all the content under "@aranki" tag.

## Vocabulary

New vocabulary was added from [arabic.desert-sky.net](https://arabic.desert-sky.net/vocab.html). You can find them under "@aranki::desert_sky" tag which includes approximately 4000 words.

## New Styles

The deck was completely redisigned in order to make learner's attention focused on content. Old styles are located in the [github repo](https://github.com/roesmaien/aranki).

## Merged Notes

The deck had some notes that were similar in context but with some minor differences (word order, position of cloze deletions, etc.). Therefore, these notes were merged into one, which makes remembering certain concepts easier. Odd notes were removed. The following concepts are:

- Concepts of (**mazid**) verbs from B3L16 to B3L25
- (**Masdar**) patterns
- Broken plural patterns

## Mistakes and Bugs

Plenty of mistakes and typos were corrected. Some bugs were removed, so the deck is now more consistent across platforms.
