## Intro

Today I publish the first ANKI version of **Madina Arabic: Book 2 (Grammar)**.

## Resources

**Regarding resources**. The Book that I've used to create this deck is **Arabic Language For Non-Native Speakers (Part 2) English Key** which is used in University of Madina. And complementary material was **ARIC - Arabic Class Notes** by Dr. AbdurRahman (thanks to him for reserving no copyrights for this material).

## Deck's Structure

**Regarding deck's structure**. I decided to divide this book into **two distinct parts**, so with the ANKI deck. One part will be dealing with *grammar*, while another is with *vocabulary*. Vocabulary (كلمات) will be finished soon. Keep yourself up to date.

### Grammar Deck
**Regarding Grammar (قواعد) deck**, there is no more subdecks in it. But it is further divided using [Hierarchical Tags 2 add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/594329229) which is essential to download in order to be able to use these tags.

## Fonts

**Regarding fonts**. Two main fonts were used in this deck. They are Charter for English and [Noto Naskh Arabic](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Naskh+Arabic?query=ISIA+Urbino%2F) for Arabic which is recommended but up to you whether to download it or not. Anyway cards will be using system default font which is also nice (on some devices). You can change both of them in *Cards... section*.

## Fields

**Regarding fields**. There are six fields in Arabic Grammar Note Type:

* cloze:Text
* Back Extra
* hint:Book Extra Notes
* hint:ARIC - Arabic Class Notes
* hint:ARIC - Tables
* hint:Personal Notes

**Cloze** and **Back Extra** will show up as you answer the card. Those, which are tagged "**hint**", require you to tap on them to show the content.
